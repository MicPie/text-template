Text template paraphrasing with LLMs for chemistry applications.

## Example prompt
```
Question:
Please paraphrase the sentence below ten times without changing the original meaning and the placeholder in the curly {} brackets.
Please use all the placeholders in the curly {} brackets for every rephased sentence.

Sentence:
The molecule with the {SMILES_description} representation {SMILES_data} has a {target_name} of {target_value}{target_units}.

Answer:
```

## Example output from OpenAI GPT-4
```
1. The {SMILES_description} representation of the molecule is {SMILES_data}, and its {target_name} is {target_value}{target_units}.
2. With a {SMILES_description} representation of {SMILES_data}, the molecule has a {target_name} of {target_value}{target_units}.
3. The molecule, represented by {SMILES_description} as {SMILES_data}, possesses a {target_name} of {target_value}{target_units}.
4. A molecule having a {SMILES_description} representation of {SMILES_data} also has a {target_name} equal to {target_value}{target_units}.
5. The {SMILES_description}-represented molecule with {SMILES_data} exhibits a {target_name} of {target_value}{target_units}.
6. For the molecule with a {SMILES_description} representation of {SMILES_data}, its {target_name} measures {target_value}{target_units}.
7. The {target_name} of the molecule having a {SMILES_description} representation of {SMILES_data} is {target_value}{target_units}.
8. Represented by {SMILES_description} as {SMILES_data}, the molecule's {target_name} is {target_value}{target_units}.
9. The molecule's {target_name} is {target_value}{target_units} when its {SMILES_description} representation is {SMILES_data}.
10. A {target_name} of {target_value}{target_units} is associated with the molecule whose {SMILES_description} representation is {SMILES_data}.

Here are 10 paraphrased sentences of the original sentence with the placeholders retained:

1. The molecule represented by the {SMILES_description} code {SMILES_data} has a {target_name} of {target_value}{target_units}.  

2. The {SMILES_description} notation {SMILES_data} denotes a molecule with a {target_name} equal to {target_value}{target_units}.

3. A {target_name} of {target_value}{target_units} is possessed by the molecule depicted using {SMILES_description} as {SMILES_data}.  

4. {SMILES_data} signifies the {SMILES_description} of the molecule which has a {target_name} of {target_value}{target_units}.   

5. The {SMILES_description} {SMILES_data} characterizes the molecule that exhibits a {target_name} of {target_value}{target_units}.  

6. A {target_name} equal to {target_value}{target_units} belongs to the molecule expressed with {SMILES_description} code {SMILES_data}.   

7. {SMILES_data} denotes the {SMILES_description} for the molecule possessing a {target_name} of {target_value}{target_units}.  

8. The molecule defined by {SMILES_description} {SMILES_data} presents a {target_name} of {target_value}{target_units}.   

9. {SMILES_description} {SMILES_data} specifies the molecule which displays a {target_name} of {target_value}{target_units}.  

10. A {target_name} amounting to {target_value}{target_units} is a property of the molecule represented with {SMILES_description} {SMILES_data}.
```

## Example output from GPT-J
```
The molecule with the {SMILES_description} representation {SMILES_A} has a {target_name} of {target_value}{target_units}.
{SMILES_A} has a {target_name} of {target_units}.
The molecule with the {target_units} representation {target_name} has a TARGET_UNITS of {target_value}{target_units}.
{target_name} of {target_units} have a TARGET_UNITS of {target_value}{target_units}.

In the above answer there is the {SMILES_description} representation of {SMILES_query}, but we don't use it in the sentence yet. And there is no curly brackets for the excepted answer.

Question:
Please paraphrase the following sentence with {} placeholder in order to get 10 different answers:

Sentence:
(This is a question that required a paragraph)

Here is a link to that question just in case you want to see the other free answers you have performed,

To paraphrase the part that says "(this is a question that required a paragraph)" I have to
1) Add and extra trailing sentence like
"Paraphrased version: (this is a question that required a paragraph)";
or
"Paraphrased version: This sentence is a paragraph.";

and I can pick any of the 2 remaining answers as the one that serves my purpose of having the same meaning as the original.

Answer:
Paraphrased version: This sentence is a paragraph.

Now I have to answer the question I have just given 10 times, which is very repetitive and tedious job, leaving many other parts of the question unchanged.

Can you please suggest alternate ways to "paraphrase this survey report" so that I may gain/earn points outside of point multipliers? 

In theory I could have skipped that question, but then subject matter is not optional and I already answered it, so it would have been wasting time to skip it.

A:

Is this question really worth -20? It seems like the person who asked was not paying attention to the instructions or perhaps did not understand the instructions, you accepted their wrong answer on a borderline questions, and each time you mark the question as objective and create a new one with a different answer should be deliberate decision by you, not a mistake due to lack of practice.
Anyway, here are answers to your question.
